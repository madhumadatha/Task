<h2 class="A"style="font-size:160%;"><i><sub>Text Categorization</sub></i></h2><hr class="A">
<p class="A"> One way to add context to a document is by assigning a meaningful label to it (Le &
 Thoma, 2003). This constitutes a task of text categorization and there exist numerous
 algorithms that can be applied. The general approach is to select a training set of
 documents that are already labelled. Based on the “bag of words” representation,
 machine learning methods learn the association of category labels to documents. For an
 in depth review of statistical approaches (such as naives Bayes or decision trees) see
 Yang (1999). Computationally more advanced methods utilize artificial neural network
 architectures such as the support vector machine which have achieved break even values
    close to 0.9 for the labelling of news wire articles (Joachims, 1998; Lodhi, 2001).</p>
    <p class="A">
 However, in the medical domain, 100 categories are seldom adequate to describe the
 context of a text. In case of the MEDLINE database, the National Library of Medicine has
 developed a highly standardized vocabulary, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
 (Lowe & Barnett, 1994). They consist of more than 35,000 categories that are hierarchi
cally organized and constitute the basis for searching the database. To guarantee
 satisfactory search results of constant quality, reproducible labels are an important
 prerequisite. However, the cost of human indexing of the biomedical literature is high:
 according to Humphrey (1992) it takes one year to train an expert the task of document
 labelling. Additionally, the labelling process lacks a high degree of reproducibility. Funk,
 Reid, and McGoogan (1983) have reported a mean agreement in index terms ranging from
 74 percent down to as low as 33 percent for different experts. Because the improvement
 of index consistency is such demanding, assistance systems are considered to be a
 substantial benefit. Recently, Aronson, Bodenreider, Chang, Humphrey, Mork, Nelson,
 Rindflesh, and Wilbur (2000) have presented a highly tuned and sophisticated system
 which yields very promising results. Additionally to the bag of words model their system
 utilizes a semantic network describing a rich ontology of biomedical knowledge (Kashyap,
 2003).</p>
<p class="A"> Unfortunately, the high complexity of the MeSH terms makes it hard to incorporate a
 MeSH-based categorization into a user interface. When navigating the results of a
 hierarchically ordered answer set it can be a time-consuming and frustrating process:
 Items which are hidden deep within the hierarchy can often only be obtained by
 descending a tree with numerous mouse-clicks. Selection of a wrong branch requires
 backing up and trying a neighboring branch. Since screen space is a limited resource only
 a small area of context is visible and requires internal “recalibration” each time a new
 branch is selected. To overcome this problem, focus and context techniques are
 considered to be of high value. These are discussed in more detail below</p>
